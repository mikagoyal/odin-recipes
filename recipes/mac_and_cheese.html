    <h3>Mac and cheese : the classic recipe of macaroni and cheese. The kids would love this!</h3>
    <p>During the end of the Great Depression, macaroni and cheese became a popular food item due to its low cost.</p>
    <p>It was billed as “the housewife's best friend, a nourishing one pot meal” and sold 8 million boxes when it was released by Kraft Foods in 1937. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1/4 onion, minced</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 pound processed cheese food</li>
        <li>1/4 pound shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 pound shredded Swiss cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Prepare the elbow macaroni according to package directions.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium high heat. Stir in the flour until a cream colored paste forms. Then pour in the milk and stir constantly until this comes to a hard boil, then stir for 1 more minute. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>When the macaroni is cooked, spread 1/2 of it into the bottom of a lightly greased 9x13-inch baking dish. Then layer 1/2 of the grated onion, 1/2 of the salt and pepper and 1/2 of each of the cheeses. Repeat this one more time: macaroni, onion, salt and pepper and cheeses, and then pour the reserved white sauce over all. Top off with small pats of butter to taste.</li>
        <li>Cover and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 minutes.</li>
